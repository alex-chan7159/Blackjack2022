 * -----Welcome to Blackjack!-----
 * The objective of the game is to draw cards totaling as close as 21, without going over.
 * If your cards total exactly 21 congratulations! Blackjack!
 * If your cards go over 21... uh oh you busted!
 * -"Hit" to draw a new card for your hand.
 * -"Stand" to end your turn and let the dealer play.
 * -"Double down" to double your bet, draw one more card, then stand.
 * -"Split".. if your first two cards are worth the same, you can choose to play them as separate hands! (your bet will be placed again on the second hand)
 * 
 * You win if your hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's, or if the dealer busts!
 * You lose if your hand is farther from 21 than the dealer's, or if you bust.
 * Good luck and have fun!
